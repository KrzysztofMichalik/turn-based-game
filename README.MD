## THESE ARE THE BASIC FOR TOURNAMENT BASED GAME

In my approach I used OOP & fabric pattern, also I decided to use PHP in the console. 

# IN ORDER TO START GAME:
* Download or clone repository into your machine.
* Into console line, enter to the application folder.
* Run composer install.
* Run script emagia.php in your console.

# THINGS TO DO BEFORE DECIDED TO DEVELOP THE GAME IN FEATURE. 
* Test the app.
* Combine it with a user interface.
